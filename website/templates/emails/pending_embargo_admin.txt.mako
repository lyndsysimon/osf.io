Hello ${user.fullname},

We just wanted to let you know that ${initiated_by} has requested an embargoed registration for a project you administer.

The proposed registration can be reviewed here: ${registration_link}.

If approved, a registration will be created for the project and it will remain private until it is retracted, manually
made public, or the embargo end date has passed on ${embargo_end_date.date()}.

To approve this action click the following link: ${approval_link}.

To disapprove this action, click the following link: ${disapproval_link}.

Note: Clicking the disapproval link will immediately cancel the pending embargo and the registration will
be deleted. If you neither approve nor disapprove the embargo within ${approval_time_span} hours from
midnight tonight (EDT) the registration will remain private and enter into an embargoed state.

Sincerely yours,

The OSF Robots
